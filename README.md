The More.less library is dedicated to make Less CSS code easier to write for cross-browser compatibility.

## Changes
From 1.1.0 to 1.2.0 was a rewrite which can break code.

Changes to 1.2.0:
- Completed testing (recess doesn't approve selection and keyframes because it is outdated)
- Cleaned up the voice stuff that wasn't used anyway.
- Upgraded some of the mixins to perform better.
